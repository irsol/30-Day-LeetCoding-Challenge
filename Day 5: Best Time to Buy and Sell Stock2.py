# Day 5: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock 2
#
# Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
#
# Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you 
# like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
            # Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
