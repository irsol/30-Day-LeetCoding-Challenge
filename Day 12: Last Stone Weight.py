# Last Stone Weight
#
# We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.
#
# Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together.
# Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:
# 
# If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
# If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has
# new weight y-x.
# At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone
# (or 0 if there are no stones left.)
